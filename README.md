# Glucose Prediction and Lifestyle Recommendations for Diabetes Management

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on analyzing health data for diabetic patients, particularly involving glucose levels, step counts, and heart rate data. The primary objectives of the project include:

1. **Data Processing and Interpolation:**
   - The project starts by processing raw data collected from diabetic patients, which includes glucose levels, daily step counts, and heart rate measurements.
   - A significant challenge addressed in the project is the presence of missing or incomplete data. To tackle this, interpolation techniques are employed to estimate and fill in the missing information, ensuring a continuous and complete dataset for analysis.

2. **Predictive Modeling for Glucose Episodes:**
   - The core of the project involves developing predictive models aimed at forecasting glucose episodes. These episodes may include hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) events.
   - Advanced machine learning algorithms are utilized to build these predictive models, which analyze the relationship between the patients' activity levels (steps), heart rate, and glucose levels.

3. **Counterfactual Explanation Algorithms:**
   - To interpret the predictions made by the models, counterfactual explanation algorithms are applied. These algorithms help in understanding what changes in the input data (specifically, the steps data) could lead to different outcomes in the predictions.
   - The goal of these explanations is to provide actionable insights. For instance, they can suggest modifications in the patients' daily step counts that could potentially lead to predictions of normal glucose levels, thereby offering practical advice for managing diabetes.

Overall, this project combines data science and healthcare to not only predict critical health episodes but also provide interpretable and actionable guidance that can aid diabetic patients in managing their condition more effectively. The use of counterfactual explanations enhances the transparency and usability of the predictive models, making them potentially more beneficial for both patients and healthcare providers.
